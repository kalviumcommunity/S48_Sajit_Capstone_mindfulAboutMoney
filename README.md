Got it! If you'd like to keep the original README image intact and find other places to display your landing page and dashboard images, here's a suggestion on how to distribute them:

1. **Keep the current README image (as it is) at the top.**
2. **Place the landing page image below the "Quick Overview" section.**
3. **Place the dashboard image after the "Feature Highlights" section to give a visual breakdown of the app's interface.**

Here’s the updated README:

```markdown
<div align="center">
	<h1>💸 Mindful About Money 💰</h1>
	<p>
		<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg" alt="Version"/>
		<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success.svg" alt="Status"/>
		<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/maverickOG/Mindful-About-Money?style=social" alt="Stars"/>
	</p>

In this version:
- The **readme image** (`readme-img.webp`) stays at the top as originally placed.
- The **landing page image** (`MaM-lp.webp`) is added below the "Quick Overview" section.
- The **dashboard image** (`MaM-d.webp`) is placed after the "Feature Highlights" section, giving a visual context to the features mentioned. 

This way, the images are spread out logically, ensuring your landing page and dashboard are showcased effectively throughout the README.
